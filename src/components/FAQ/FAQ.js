            1. What do these credentials mean?

            Cami is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), which is a license given by the state of Colorado to practice as a mental health counselor. It is obtained after receiving a Master’s degree in Psychology, meeting the required hours working in the field, meeting supervision requirements, and passing the exam.

            Colorado has 4 levels of certification in the addictions field, the first three levels consist of being a Certified Addictions Counselor (CAC I, CAC II, or CAC III). The fourth and highest level is becoming a Licensed Addiction Counselor (LAC). It requires a Master’s degree as well as the education in addiction counseling, hours practicing in the field, supervision hours, and passing an exam.

            On a national level, there are three levels for addiction counseling and the Master Addiction Counseling (MAC) is the highest of the three levels. It requires a Master’s degree along with passing an exam and meeting qualifications for supervision and hours spent in addiction counseling.

            2. Is my insurance accepted?

            Cami does not bill the insurance directly and would be considered an out-of-network provider. Many insurance providers will cover either a dollar amount or a percentage of the fees for out-of-network mental health providers. Cami would be happy to work with you to get you the documentation that you need to submit to your insurance to obtain reimbursement.

            3. How long does therapy take?

            The length of treatment is based on many factors, and is tailored to each individual circumstance. The goal is to make sure that each session is used well so that therapy is as effective and efficient as possible. To reach this goal the therapist and client will work together to make sure that there is progress toward the goals that are set.

            4. If my adolescent is in therapy, how much will I as a parent be involved?

            It is important to have parents be involved when working with adolescents. In the first appointment the parents and adolescent meet together with the therapist to determine the goals of therapy and assure that everyone is on the same page. The rules of confidentiality still apply, so the adolescent will have a place where they can say whatever is important to them without details being shared. It is important to have parent input to help the client stay grounded in reality and to help assess change and progress with the adolescent. Parents are specifically involved whenever there is a safety concern, and when something may help to improve parenting. Often the adolescent and Cami will discuss in advance what will be shared with their parents to decide how to tell the parents, the client alone, the therapist alone, or both together.

            5. What should I look for in a therapist?

            There are many factors that may influence your choice in a therapist and help you determine the best fit. One of the best ways to assess if it will be a good fit is to take some time to talk to the therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment. This gives one the chance to ask questions about the therapist’s views of therapy, change, and their areas of experience. It also gives one a chance to ask about education and credentials to make sure that the therapist has the education and licensing that is the best fit for your situation.
